# SnakeVideoGame
Simple Snake Game made with Python

<br>

Hey There,

This repo contains the classic Snake game that we all know from the old phones.

I've used **pygame** library to create the game.

### Source

The game here is based on this [course's](https://www.udemy.com/python-game-development-creating-a-snake-game-from-scratch/) game by [Root Labs](https://www.udemy.com/user/suraj-sharma-6/). But I've changed/added many things to suit my needs.

### What is pygame?

**pygame** (the library) is a Free and Open Source python programming language library for making multimedia applications like games built on top of the excellent SDL library. Like SDL, pygame is highly portable and runs on nearly every platform and operating system. Millions of people have downloaded pygame itself, which is a whole lot of bits flying across the interwebs.

Then, go to this [link](https://www.pygame.org/docs/). It covers every info to get started with pygame. I learnt about pygame through this [link](https://www.pygame.org/docs/), above mentioned [course](https://www.udemy.com/python-game-development-creating-a-snake-game-from-scratch/) and stackoverflow. You are free to use and enjoy this game or take this game as a sample code while learning pygame.
